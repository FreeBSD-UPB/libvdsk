.Nm vdsk_flush
.Nd flush any pending writes to the disk, disk partition or disk image file
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libvdsk
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In vdsk.h
.Ft int
.Fn vdsk_flush "vdskctx vdsk"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm vdsk_flush
function makes sure that any unwritten modifications are written to the
disk, disk partition or disk image file.
For image files, this can include writes for metadata as well as data
blocks.
A flush typically involves a call to
.Xr fsync 2
to make sure the kernel writes buffers to disk as well.
